## Add Forms and Content Management to your Vue App

Usage is simple:

    vue create my-project
    cd my-project
    vue add contentservice
    vue add formservice

You can then view the site in development mode:

    yarn serve

Open your browser at http://localhost:8080.

### Managing the Content
To edit the content of the page press `control-option-escape` on a Mac or `control-alt-escape` on Windows.

> Note that the content shown is example data. Change it as you wish, but be aware that
> other people will see anything you enter, and also that the content gets reset
> regularly without warning so your changes may disappear.

### Further Information
To customise the site, or edit your own content see [ContentService.io](http://contentservice.io).
